64-bit Intel → use qemu-system-x86_64

"-cpu max" → emulate a CPU similar to your real one

"-smp 1" → only 1 CPU core

"-display none" → no graphical window, only console

"-serial stdio" → connect serial to your terminal

"-kernel image" → boot the “image” file we will build in next post


Dry Run of QEMU Command

"qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu max -smp 1 -display none -kernel image -serial stdio"

Expected output:

Could not open 'image'
